# StackIt – A Minimal Q&A Forum Platform

**StackIt** is a clean and minimal community Q&A web application focused on collaborative learning and structured knowledge sharing. Built using modern frontend tools like **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the platform provides a distraction-free environment for users to ask questions, post answers, and interact with peers efficiently.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In most academic and developer communities, there's no organized way to ask questions and share answers meaningfully. Chats become cluttered, and information is hard to trace.

**StackIt** solves this by providing:
- A structured and tag-based interface for asking questions
- Rich-format answers with voting
- A minimal UI for clarity and speed
- Community features like answer acceptance and future notifications
