## 🎯 Problem Statement

In academic or developer communities, students often need a structured space for discussion. Traditional chat tools aren't optimized for searchable, topic-focused Q&A.

**StackIt** provides a minimal and efficient Q&A experience — helping users:
- Ask detailed questions using tags and formatting
- Post helpful answers
- Vote and accept answers
- Get notified when relevant activity occurs
